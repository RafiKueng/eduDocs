<h1>Gravitational Lensing - Modelling</h1>

<div class="topic">
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <div class="topicgroup">
    <div class="topicbox">
      <p>
        This is an interactive tutorial explaining gravitational lensing in theory and the process of creating models for gravitational lenses.<br/>
        You can click on any <i id="reveal">underlined word to reveal</i> additional information. The color of the background shows the difficulty of the materials:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yellow items need some time to digest, but are nice to know</li>
        <li>Red items mean a highschool background would be favourable, but the information is only additional and not really needed to understand gravitational lensing and modelling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are two ways you can go though this tutorial, either by reading at you own pace, or by watching at the videos, explaining each section.</p>

      <h3>Light</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          You can consider light as a bunch of moving <i id="particles">particles</i>. Those particles are sent out by a lightsource and travel with the speed of light. They take the path to the observer, that take them the least amount of time, the shortest path <i id="path">(which is often, but not always a straight line)</i>. But they also take paths that are the longest, or saddle points. This will be explained later in details.

      <h4>Particle vs Wave</h4>
      <div>
        Waveâ€“particle duality postulates that all particles exhibit both wave and particle properties. A central concept of quantum mechanics, this duality addresses the inability of classical concepts like "particle" and "wave" to fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. Standard interpretations of quantum mechanics explain this paradox as a fundamental property of the Universe.[1]<br>
        For this applications it's sufficiant to only look at light as a particle.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="topicbox adv" id="_path">
      <h4>Straight Path</h4>
      <p>
        Usually, light does take a straight path through space, because it's the shortest path between two points. If space is curved thou, this straight path becomes a curved path for an outside observer.<br>
        Compare this to a initally flat rubber sheet. The shortest path on this sheet between diagonal edges is a straight line. If you put an heavy object in the middle of the sheet, it's surface gets expanded and forms a hopper. The shortest path between the two points on this curved surface is now a curved line along the outer parts of this hopper, not the straight line throu the hopper.

      <h3>General Relativity</h3>
      <p>
        To put is short, General Realitity states that <i id="mass">masses</i> bend <i id="spacetime">space</i>. (...among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">many other things</a>) Almost like a human on a trampoline bends its surface.<br>
        This effect is really tiny, unless you deal with huge masses like stars (for micro lensing) or even galaxies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topicbox exp" id="_mass">
      <h4>What is mass?</h4>
      <p>
        There is luminous matter in the universe. This is the one that we can see in our everyday life. If we watch throu a telescope, it's the things we can see. Physicists estimate that the universe consitsts of 17% of luminous matter.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there is dark matter, which is ca. 80% of the matter in the universe. One can't see it direcly (hence DARK matter), but one can see it's effect on luminous matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our purpose we don't distinguish between lumnious and dark matter.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="topicbox exp" id="_spacetime">
      <h4>space time</h4>
      <div class="topictext">
        Actually, masses curve space AND time. For this reason, physicists often put those two, space and time, together to a single, 4 dimentional constuct called spacetime.
